# MPD Bsky Bot
This is a modified code based on bsky [cookbook](https://github.com/bluesky-social/cookbook/tree/main/ts-bot).
The bot will post your current music playing and then post it in your bluesky account.

**By default, the MPD will use `6600` port** but you can change the port number however you like.

## Set Up

1. Copy or rename `example.env` to `.env` and fill your bluesky username and password.
2. That's it.

## Running the script

1. Run the script locally: `node index.js`. You should see a current music
   playing posted to your Bluesky account.
2. Modify the script however you like to make this bot your own!

## Note
Typescript version will be implemented soon. I need to find a way to learn typescript and handling the error.
